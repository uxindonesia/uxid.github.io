  <h1>Testing display of HTML elements</h1>

  <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

  <p>This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element).
  To add some length to it, let us mention that this page was
  primarily written for testing the effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>.
  You can use it for various other purposes as well, like just checking how
  your browser displays various HTML elements by default.
  It can also be useful when testing conversions from HTML
  format to other formats, since some elements can go wrong then.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph. I think it needs to be added that
  the set of elements tested is not exhaustive in any sense. I have selected
  those elements for which it can make sense to write user style sheet rules,
  in my opionion.</p>
