<p>Unlike other community, UXID has no organizational structure. It’s a fully autonomous community that is run by the community itself. Yes, there are people who —. But they’re only there to make sure that all the community’s activities are aligned with UXID’s mission to build the community, and ensure that the community stays as friendly, welcoming, and respectful as we want it to be. These people are only acted as moderators and have no authority whatsoever over UXID.</p>
